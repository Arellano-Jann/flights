1. list flights (table)
4. add flight (form)
2. update flight (button -> form)
3. filterFlight (filter table)
5. graphView - graph relations of all flights - nodal
6. solve best path - (input num of destinations to visit)

- remove sort (actions) in table-data
- make column disappear if nothing inside? (maybe this is kinda handled by the hide button)

- ensure data validation (min cost < max cost)
